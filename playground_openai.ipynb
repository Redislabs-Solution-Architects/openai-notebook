AC charging time refers to a charging power of 11 kW; DC charging time refers to a charging power of 200 kW.\\\\n3  Official data for power consumption and electric range was determined in accordance with the prescribed measuring procedure and corresponds to European Regulation (EU) 715/2007 in the applicable version. For ranges, data determined as per WL TP takes into account any optional equipment (available on the German market in this case). For vehicles that have been newly type approved since 1 January 2021, only the official data according to WL TP exists. For more information about NEDC and WL TP measuring procedures visit www.bmw.com/wltp\\\\n4 The combined power consumption depends on the selected wheel and tyre sizes\\\\n5  As of 1 September 2017, the type approval for certain new vehicles is granted according to the Worldwide harmonised Light vehicles T est Procedure (WL TP), a new, more realistic test procedure to measure the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. As of 1 September 2018, the WL TP replaced the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the previous test procedure. As a result of the more realistic test conditions, the fuel consumption and CO2 emission values measured as per WL TP are, in many cases, higher than the values measured according to the NEDC.\\\\n6 Range depends on various factors, in particular: individual driving style, route characteristics, outside temperature, heating/air conditioning, pre-conditioning.', metadata={'id': 'doc:chatbot:8566a988f04941a79ac0608cb8dc559c', 'source': 'pdfs/The BMW i4 - Brochure.pdf', 'page': '24'}), Document(page_content='â–  The combination of the rear wheel drive and the BMW eDrive engine give the  \\\\nfirst-ever fully-electric BMW i4 an outstanding sporty feel.
